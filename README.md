# ANALYSIS
I was able to draw the following insightsfrom the analysis 
 
**_Question 1_**

I deduced from the analysis that the highest rated restaurants had the highest average food rating as well as the highest average service rating 

**_Question 2_**

The consumers demographics was such mas occupation and budget were plotted against the       average customer age which is 27.30% and it was deduced that The consumers demographics When it comes to budget suggests that 29.81% consumers did not account for their budget, also 32.44% of the consumers didn’t also provide information on their occupation. Hence we can conclude that there is a bias in the customer’s data 

**_Question 3_**

There is a demand and supply gap. From the analysis, 63% of the customers are drinkers and 87 out of the 130 restaurants do not have alcohol service 

**_Question 4_**

If I am to invest in a restaurant, I would look out for parking space, an open area where the restaurant is situated, and lastly I will look out for a restaurant with a full bar	

# RECOMMENDATION
- The customers should be enlightened on how to fill the survey properly in order to get the right information and avoid bias
- More of the restaurants should look into providing alcohol service because it would improve sales significantly
